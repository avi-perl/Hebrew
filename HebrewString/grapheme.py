        This differs from the normal python `in` operator, since the python operator will return
        true if the sequence of codepoints are withing the other string without considering
        grapheme boundaries.

        Performance notes: Very fast if `substring not in string`, since that also means that
        the same graphemes can not be in the two strings. Otherwise this function has linear time
        complexity in relation to the string length. It will traverse the sequence of graphemes until
        a match is found, so it will generally perform better for grapheme sequences that match early.

        Returns the highest index up to `max_len` at which the given string can be sliced, without breaking a grapheme.

        This is useful for when you want to split or take a substring from a string, and don't really care about
        the exact grapheme length, but don't want to risk breaking existing graphemes.

        This function does normally not traverse the full grapheme sequence up to the given length, so it can be used
        for arbitrarily long strings and high `max_len`s. However, some grapheme boundaries depend on the previous state,
        so the worst case performance is O(n). In practice, it's only very long non-broken sequences of country flags
        (represented as Regional Indicators) that will perform badly.

        The return value will always be between `0` and `len(string)`.
